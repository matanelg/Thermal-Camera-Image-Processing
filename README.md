# Image Processing For Thermal Camera

## Introduction

During the FEL-THz accelerator operation at Ariel University, hazardous ionizing radiation is emitted.<br />
In addition accelerator's overheat can create research errors and even damage the accelerator itself.<br />
Therefore, there is a need to develop a control and diagnostic system that will monitor the heat levels in the accelerator at any given moment and alert the user in the event of an abnormal temperature exceeding 50 Â° C. For this purpose, a FLIR-Ax8 thermal camera was purchased which will be located in the accelerator room and operated from the control room by an image processing algorithm in LabVIEW development environment. The system will alert the user by voice and visual alert, photograph and save the thermal image and record the image data in a CSV file.
